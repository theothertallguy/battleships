# CPSC 210 Personal Project: *Battleships*

#### Nate Sternberg

## Project Overview
In this project, I am aiming to develop a working version of the classic game *Battleships*. The idea is that the game
will be set up so that the user can start a new game against a computer or another human, or continue their previous
game. The game will be set up using the classic 10x10 grid style, and players will be able to place their ships on the 
grid where they want to put them.

This project is of interest to me because *Battleships* is one of the games that I remember particularly from my
childhood. I remember playing it a lot in a variety of different settings, and I decided it would be a fun way
to pay homage to one of my favourite games. The target audience for this game is anyone who wants to play a game
of *Battleships*! My hope is that the game will run well, and that it will be a good way to expand my Java knowledge.
